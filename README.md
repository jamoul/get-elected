## About this project

This was the final project for the Procedural Programming course at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. To demonstrate an understanding of Python and basic object-oriented programming, we created this simulator of elections in North Carolina.

To use the script, merely run it. The newCandidate() function should prompt you to enter the issue positions of your candidate. Based on county demographics and issue polling, the script will simulate the electoral margin of your candidate's campaign in each county of the state.
